                <h3>The purpose of the project:</h3>
                <p>The chosen topic of this project is medicine, which I worked on with the help of my aunt and uncle
                    The purpose of this project is to guide you to the doctor if you have any problems.
                    the two branches of medicine that have been chosen in this project are family medicine and urology, where my aunt is a specialist in family medicine and my uncle is a specialist in urology.
                </p>
                <h3>Importance of doctors:</h3>
                <p>Doctors save lives, but their importance goes far beyond that. Doctors also make a difference by helping patients minimize pain, recover from a disease faster or learn to live with a disabling injury. A patient's ability to enjoy life, even if they can't be cured, makes a huge difference to them and to their families. If they can go back to work after an illness, that benefits their employer, too. And, that's only part of what makes doctors important to society.
                </p>
                <h3>The importance of Hospitals:</h3>
                <p>Hospitals matter to people and often mark central points in their lives. They also matter to health systems by being instrumental for care coordination and integration. They often provide a setting for education of doctors, nurses and other health-care professionals and are a critical base for clinical research.</p>
